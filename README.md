# Eye-Controlled-Mouse
Our Python-based eye-controlled mouse uses OpenCV and computer vision techniques to track eye movements via a standard laptop camera, eliminating the need for external hardware. This system enables precise, hands-free cursor control, enhancing accessibility for individuals with physical disabilities and redefining human-computer interaction.
